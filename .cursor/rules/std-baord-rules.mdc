- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
Use Kendo UI Functions where possible
'date of last exposure' should have a taxtbox editor not a datepicker
There is no 'arrary' type for kendo, it would need to be 'object' in that case
This Project us is a Kendo UI, Wordpress with Advanced Custom fields plugin and WPgraphQL Plugin.
Use Kendo UI Best Practices
Do not add new functionality unless confirmed by the user, unless it resolves an error
Do not assume, confirm with the user.
